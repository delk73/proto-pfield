# Description
Briefly describe the changes.

## Contract Review
- [ ] I have reviewed the [PrecisionField Contracts](docs/precisionfield/10_contracts.md).
- [ ] My changes preserve **Domain Inheritance** (parent warps affect all siblings identically).
- [ ] My changes do not introduce **Shadow State** (authoritative state remains in `store.ts`).

## Verification
- [ ] `Purge_Cache` and visual verification of the Regression Suite passed.
- [ ] Consistency check (Shield icon in Editor) returns "Contract Verified".
- [ ] Undo/Redo functionality verified for new features.
